# Uptime Kuma — declared monitors and future reconciliation

**Status:** Desired monitor declarations only. No service creation, monitor
mutation, login or live endpoint verification has been performed.

## Project Joule request

The [Wicket Ollama monitor request](https://github.com/wdcallahan/sanctum-services/issues/4)
is captured as a stable entry in `data/kuma-monitors.yml`:

- Name: `Wicket Ollama`
- HTTP URL: `http://wicket.arcane.sanctum:11435/healthz`
- Expected response: 200–299; actual Kuma UI state must show **Up**
- Probe location: the **retained** Uptime Kuma instance after its Kvin
  deployment/restore and networking have been accepted.

This is Project Joule's service health contract. Services owns only Kuma.

## Adoption conditions

The Kvar Kuma instance was a proof of concept; the operator allows a clean
retained Kvin instance instead of requiring migration of the old monitor
database. Do not change abandoned test installations or accidentally send
duplicate alerts. Preserve wanted state in code and verify persistent
monitor state after disaster restore.

Uptime Kuma's documented REST surface is not a universal monitor-write API.
Monitor creation/editing commonly uses authenticated Socket.IO and may vary
between Kuma versions. Select an actual version-qualified, testable
reconciliation interface before coding monitor mutations. Avoid direct SQLite
editing and do not put credentials into Git.

When Kuma is managed properly, load these declarations, reconcile by stable
monitor identity (not an unconditional add), and verify both a second
unchanged run and an actual **Up** observation in the retained instance.
A successful curl from the controller alone does not meet that acceptance.
