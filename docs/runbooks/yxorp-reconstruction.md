# YXORP — plain Nginx on a rootful Podman Quadlet

**Current source state, November 9, 2026:** Peanut is the explicitly selected
full-port, full-LAN trial host. Kvin remains the intended production host.
Kvar's incumbent Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) remains online until a separate
accepted cutover. Source CI is not a native Peanut deployment receipt.

## Same service architecture in trial and production

| | Peanut trial | Kvin after cutover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | `yxorp_test` | `yxorp` |
| Container | Rootful Podman Quadlet | Rootful Podman Quadlet |
| Listener | `0.0.0.0:80` | `0.0.0.0:80` |
| HTTP | Plain internal HTTP | Plain internal HTTP |
| Image input | `docker.io/library/nginx:stable-alpine` | ARM64 qualified image digest, until update policy promoted |
| Service name | `sanctum-yxorp-peanut-test.service` | `sanctum-yxorp.service` |
| Existing traffic | Unchanged; test via Peanut hostname + Host header | Separate reviewed DNS cutover required |

There is **no localhost-only or high-port workaround**. The trial really
binds TCP/80 on Peanut, subject to Peanut's existing Maintenance-managed
firewall policy. Nothing here changes the firewall or DNS to make it
reachable. Test and production target groups are separate, so running the
Peanut playbook cannot target Kvin.

The checked-in route list [`data/yxorp-routes.yml`](../../data/yxorp-routes.yml)
currently enables only the newly proposed
`yarn.nexus.sanctum` → `http://yarn.inner.sanctum:80` route.
The other observed NPM routes remain declared but disabled until their
applications and consumer behavior are accepted. The NPM administrative
UI itself is retired rather than reproduced.

## First trial: Kvin controller, Peanut target

From `~/src/sanctum-services` on Kvin:

```bash
git pull
~/.local/bin/ansible-navigator run ansible/yxorp-peanut.yml
```

The first imported play is a **read-only preflight**. It checks Peanut's
identity, that TCP/80 is unoccupied or belongs to its existing trial service,
and that the active firewall's Ethernet interface zone admits `http` or
`80/tcp`. If a port or firewall gate fails, **the deployment play is not
reached**. Do not stop an unrelated service or bypass Maintenance firewall
ownership to make this test run. The independent read-only
`ansible/yxorp-peanut-preflight.yml` may also be run alone for diagnosis.

Once the preflight passes, the ordinary Services YXORP role:

1. validates the selected host and route inputs,
2. renders the version-controlled Nginx configuration,
3. checks/pulls the selected container image and validates the candidate
   using Nginx in a disposable Podman **bridge** container,
4. installs only the trial's own Nginx configuration and system Quadlet,
5. starts its generated systemd service and checks the local health path.

Quadlet's `[Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target` manages boot startup;
the transient generated service must not be explicitly enabled via
`systemctl enable`. No NPM, DNS, Kvar, Kvin service or host firewall
is modified by the trial installer.

**Actual network-client smoke**, from Kvin:

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-navigator run ansible/yxorp-peanut-probe.yml
```

This queries `http://peanut.arcane.sanctum/__yxorp_health` and the
Yarn route through Peanut over HTTP/80 using
`Host: yarn.nexus.sanctum`. It runs on Kvin as a *different host*, not
inside the Nginx container. A successful probe confirms bounded HTTP
routing from that vantage point, **not** complete app/browser acceptance.
Once available, test with a real browser/client from the intended segments
before claiming availability to everyone. The original DNS entry still
points to Kvar; direct client testing should send the desired Host header
or use a temporary per-request URL-to-address override, not reconfigure
authoritative DNS.

## Reversal: remove the entire temporary Peanut service

The separately named `ansible/yxorp-peanut-remove.yml` targets
**Peanut only**. It checks the actual Quadlet contains exactly
`ContainerName=sanctum-yxorp-peanut-test` and
`PublishPort=0.0.0.0:80:80/tcp`, inventories the known configuration
files including hidden entries, then stops the trial, removes its own
Quadlet, reloads systemd and removes only its own config directory.
Unexpected files, symlinks or altered listener scope cause refusal.
It leaves the cached image, Kvar, DNS, firewalls and app data intact.

The trial's scoped remove authorization is present because Nova chose
this test. Removing **production** YXORP later is a separate operation
requiring DNS, proxy references, monitor, consumer and rollback coordination
with the actual owners. Simply deleting a production container is not
the complete reverse of having published the service.

## Native evidence and image lifecycle

Kvar's actual NPM upstream comparison is in
[2026-11-09 default-route review](../review/2026-11-09-yxorp-default-route-comparison.md).
Its separately executed bounded generated-behavior inspection is
[here](../review/2026-11-09-yxorp-behavior-observation.md).
Neither needs repeating just for demonstration.

Kvin previously qualified the *official Nginx ARM64 digest* with Podman
image inspection and an ephemeral offline `nginx -t`; see
[image qualification](yxorp-image-qualification.md).
That proves the image parser, **not** client service. The Peanut test uses
the normal maintained `stable-alpine` tag on its own architecture instead.
The role currently pulls a tagged image **when missing**; routine
flowing-image updates and rollback are still incomplete and must be
demonstrated rather than treated as delivered. Native Podman
`AutoUpdate=registry` may be a suitable future mechanism, but a systemd
restart alone does not prove that clients can use the service.
No automatic-update timer is enabled by this test.

**Production is not authorized:** the Kvin group vars retain
`yxorp_production_cutover_approved: false`. The intended deployment
is rootful, on TCP/80, available on the LAN subject to reviewed firewall
policy and DNS cutover. Kvar stays online for rollback until real
application/client behavior and the chosen lifetime update/reversal
strategy are accepted.
